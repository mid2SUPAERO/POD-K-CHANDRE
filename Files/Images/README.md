## Images

In the following folders, one can find the different images proposed as solution of the internship. In each final folder, one can
find the different configurations (See [Table 2 in the Report Synthesis](https://github.com/mid2SUPAERO/Stage_CHANDRE_POD/blob/master/Report/report-internship-onera.pdf)) separated and, inside, all the cases are identified (See [Table 1 on the Report Synthesis](https://github.com/mid2SUPAERO/Stage_CHANDRE_POD/blob/master/Report/report-internship-onera.pdf)).

For the circulation images, four subimages are presented: the real value, the mean value and +- 3 times the variance. The goal of presenting all the results is to ensure that both the mean and the real results have values between the variance results.

For the displacement images, two folders can be found: 1) Mean value between variance results; 2) Real value between variance results. Here, it is essential to note that an artificial deformation ratio has been applied to give the deformed wing image, the visual effect of them must not be taken as real (but the values can).
